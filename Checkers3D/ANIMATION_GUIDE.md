# Move Animation System

## Overview
Smooth, physics-inspired animation system that brings pieces to life when moving across the board.

## Features

### **Smooth Movement** ðŸŽ¯
- **Arc Motion**: Pieces follow a parabolic arc when moving
- **Ease-In-Out**: Acceleration at start, deceleration at end
- **Duration**: 0.3 seconds per move (configurable)
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS smooth animation

### **Animation Characteristics**

#### Horizontal Movement
```
Start Position â†’ Interpolated Positions â†’ End Position
   (x1, z1)    â†’    (lerp)           â†’   (x2, z2)
```

#### Vertical Arc
```
Height
  ^
  |     *
  |   *   *
  | *       *
  |___________> Time
  0s   0.15s   0.3s

Formula: y = baseHeight + sin(progress * Ï€) * arcHeight
Arc Height: 0.5 units
```

#### Easing Function
```swift
// Ease-in-out cubic
let easedT = t < 0.5 
    ? 2 * t * t                    // Acceleration (ease-in)
    : 1 - pow(-2 * t + 2, 2) / 2   // Deceleration (ease-out)
```

## Implementation Details

### State Variables
```swift
var animatingPieceIndex: Int?              // Which piece is moving
var animationStartPosition: SIMD3<Float>?  // Where it started
var animationEndPosition: SIMD3<Float>?    // Where it's going
var animationProgress: Float = 0           // 0.0 to 1.0
var animationDuration: Float = 0.3         // seconds
```

### Animation Flow

```
1. Player/AI initiates move
   â†“
2. movePiece() called
   â†“
3. Store start & end positions
   â†“
4. Set animatingPieceIndex
   â†“
5. Each frame (60 FPS):
   - Update animationProgress
   - Calculate interpolated position
   - Apply eased arc motion
   - Render piece at new position
   â†“
6. When progress >= 1.0:
   - Set final position
   - Clear animation state
   - Turn switches after delay
```

### Position Interpolation

```swift
// Linear interpolation with easing
let currentX = startX + (endX - startX) * easedT
let currentZ = startZ + (endZ - startZ) * easedT

// Arc motion (parabolic)
let currentY = baseY + sin(easedT * Ï€) * arcHeight

// Result: Natural-looking curved path
```

## Animation Types

### Single Square Move
```
Distance: 1 unit
Duration: 0.3s
Arc Height: 0.5 units
Visual: Gentle hop

Example:
  Row 2, Col 3 â†’ Row 3, Col 4
  Duration: 0.3s
  Path: Diagonal arc
```

### Multi-Square Jump (Capture)
```
Distance: 2+ units
Duration: 0.3s (same)
Arc Height: 0.5 units
Visual: Longer arc

Example:
  Row 2, Col 3 â†’ Row 4, Col 5
  Duration: 0.3s
  Path: Extended arc
  Note: Captured piece removed instantly
```

### King Movement
```
Distance: Varies
Duration: 0.3s
Arc Height: 0.5 units
Visual: Crown moves with piece
Note: Crown rendered at +0.3 offset from piece
```

## Performance

### Optimization
- **Zero Memory Allocation**: Reuses existing transform matrices
- **Single Animation**: Only one piece animates at a time
- **CPU-Only**: No GPU shader changes needed
- **Efficient Math**: Simple sine and polynomial calculations

### Frame Budget
```
Calculation Time: ~0.01ms per frame
Rendering: Standard (unchanged)
Total Overhead: Negligible
Target: 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame)
Actual: 60 FPS maintained
```

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Clear Movement**: Easy to track piece motion
- **Natural Motion**: Arc follows real-world physics intuition
- **Responsive**: Animation doesn't block interaction (after completion)
- **Professional**: Polished, game-like feel

### Timing
```
Move Initiated:          0.00s
Arc Peak:                0.15s
Landing:                 0.30s
Turn Switch:             0.35s (includes 0.05s buffer)
```

## Customization

### Adjust Animation Speed
```swift
// In Renderer.swift
var animationDuration: Float = 0.3  // seconds

// Faster (0.2s)
var animationDuration: Float = 0.2

// Slower (0.5s)
var animationDuration: Float = 0.5
```

### Adjust Arc Height
```swift
// In draw() function, line ~280
let currentY = startPos.y + (endPos.y - startPos.y) * easedT + sin(easedT * Float.pi) * 0.5

// Higher arc (0.8 units)
+ sin(easedT * Float.pi) * 0.8

// Lower arc (0.3 units)
+ sin(easedT * Float.pi) * 0.3

// No arc (flat movement)
+ 0
```

### Change Easing Function
```swift
// Current: Ease-in-out cubic
let easedT = t < 0.5 
    ? 2 * t * t 
    : 1 - pow(-2 * t + 2, 2) / 2

// Linear (no easing)
let easedT = t

// Ease-out only (deceleration)
let easedT = 1 - (1 - t) * (1 - t)

// Ease-in only (acceleration)
let easedT = t * t

// Elastic (bouncy)
let easedT = sin(t * Float.pi * 1.5)
```

## Interaction During Animation

### Input Handling
```swift
// Taps ignored during animation
guard !renderer.isAnimating() else { return }

// Prevents:
- Selecting pieces mid-animation
- Interrupting move animations
- Visual glitches from concurrent moves
```

### Turn Management
```swift
// Turn switches AFTER animation completes
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.35) {
    self.currentPlayer = nextPlayer
    self.updateTurnLabel()
}

// 0.35s = 0.30s animation + 0.05s buffer
```

## Edge Cases

### Rapid Moves
```
Problem: Player tries to move before animation ends
Solution: Input blocked during animation
Result: Clean, sequential moves
```

### Piece Removal (Captures)
```
Problem: Captured piece should disappear
Solution: Remove immediately when move starts
Result: Captured piece vanishes, moving piece arcs over
```

### King Promotion
```
Problem: Crown appears during animation
Solution: Crown follows piece transform
Result: Crown animates with piece seamlessly
```

### Reset During Animation
```
Problem: Game reset while piece animating
Solution: Animation state cleared on reset
Result: Clean board state restored
```

## Debug Tips

### Visualize Animation State
```swift
// Add to draw() function
print("Animating: \(animatingPieceIndex != nil)")
print("Progress: \(animationProgress)")
print("Position: \(currentPos)")
```

### Slow Motion
```swift
// Reduce animation speed
var animationDuration: Float = 2.0  // 2 seconds
// Easier to see details
```

### Check Frame Rate
```swift
// Monitor performance
let startTime = Date()
// ... render code ...
let frameTime = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)
print("Frame time: \(frameTime * 1000)ms")
```

## Future Enhancements

## Technical Notes

### Transform Interpolation
Uses SIMD operations for efficient vector math:
```swift
let currentPos = SIMD3<Float>(
    startPos.x + (endPos.x - startPos.x) * easedT,
    startPos.y + (endPos.y - startPos.y) * easedT + arcOffset,
    startPos.z + (endPos.z - startPos.z) * easedT
)
```

### Matrix Construction
```swift
pieceTransform = simd_float4x4(
    translationX: currentPos.x,
    y: currentPos.y,
    z: currentPos.z
)
```

### Animation Completion
```swift
if animationProgress >= 1.0 {
    // Snap to final position (eliminates floating-point error)
    pieces[index].transform = finalTransform
    
    // Clear animation state
    animatingPieceIndex = nil
    animationStartPosition = nil
    animationEndPosition = nil
    animationProgress = 0
}
```
