## 🛠 Building & Testing

### Build the Project

```bash
# From command line
cd /Users/damirk/Projects/labtiva/copilot/Checkers3D
xcodebuild -project Checkers3D.xcodeproj -scheme Checkers3D -sdk iphonesimulator
```

Or use Xcode:
- **Build**: `⌘B`
- **Run**: `⌘R`
- **Clean**: `⌘K`

### Requirements

- **Xcode**: 14.0 or later
- **iOS**: 15.0 or later
- **Metal**: Required (all modern iOS devices)
- **Device**: iPhone or iPad

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `Renderer.swift` and look for color definitions:

```swift
// Red pieces
let redColor = SIMD4<Float>(0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0)

// Black pieces
let blackColor = SIMD4<Float>(0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 1.0)

// Board colors
let lightSquare = SIMD4<Float>(0.83, 0.65, 0.45, 1.0)
let darkSquare = SIMD4<Float>(0.55, 0.44, 0.28, 1.0)
```

### Adjusting AI Difficulty

In `AIPlayer.swift`:

```swift
// Change search depth (higher = smarter but slower)
private var maxDepth = 4  // Easy: 2, Medium: 4, Hard: 6
```

### Animation Speed

In `Renderer.swift`:

```swift
var animationDuration: Float = 0.3  // Move animation (seconds)
var captureAnimationDuration: Float = 0.4  // Capture animation
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Project Won't Build**
   - Clean build folder: `⌘K` then `⌘B`
   - Check iOS deployment target is 15.0+
   - Ensure all source files are in the project

2. **Blank Screen**
   - Check Metal is supported on device
   - Verify shaders compiled successfully
   - Check console for error messages

3. **No Sound**
   - Sound files are referenced but may need to be added
   - Check Sound Manager for file paths
   - Ensure device is not in silent mode

4. **AI Not Moving**
   - Check console for AI thinking logs
   - Verify AI Player is initialized
   - Make sure it's Black's turn
