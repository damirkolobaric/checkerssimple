# AI Player Implementation

## Overview
The 3D Checkers game now includes an intelligent AI opponent that plays as the black pieces using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI Capabilities
- **Strategic Planning**: Uses minimax algorithm to look ahead multiple moves
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes search by eliminating unnecessary branches
- **Position Evaluation**: Considers piece value, board position, and king control
- **Capture Priority**: Always captures when possible (follows checkers rules)
- **Multi-Jump Detection**: Handles chain captures correctly

### ðŸŽ® Difficulty Levels

| Level | Search Depth | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Easy** | 2 moves ahead | Makes occasional random moves (30% chance) |
| **Medium** | 4 moves ahead | Balanced strategic play (default) |
| **Hard** | 6 moves ahead | Near-optimal play, very challenging |

### ðŸŽ¯ Evaluation Criteria

The AI evaluates board positions based on:

1. **Piece Value** (10 points per piece)
   - Regular pieces: 10 points
   - Kings: 30 points (3x value)

2. **Position Bonuses** (up to 14 points)
   - Center control: +2 to +14 points
   - Edge penalty: -3 points
   - Advancement bonus: 0 to +14 points

3. **Strategic Factors**
   - King promotion opportunities
   - Capture chains
   - Board control

## How It Works

### Game Flow
```
1. Player (Red) makes move
   â†“
2. AI (Black) starts thinking
   â†“
3. AI explores possible moves using minimax
   â†“
4. AI selects best move
   â†“
5. AI executes move after 0.5s delay
   â†“
6. Back to Player's turn
```

### Minimax Algorithm
```swift
function minimax(state, depth, alpha, beta, isMaximizing):
    if depth == 0:
        return evaluateBoard(state)
    
    if isMaximizing (AI):
        maxScore = -âˆž
        for each move:
            score = minimax(newState, depth-1, alpha, beta, false)
            maxScore = max(maxScore, score)
            alpha = max(alpha, score)
            if beta â‰¤ alpha:
                break  // Alpha-Beta pruning
        return maxScore
    else (Player):
        minScore = +âˆž
        for each move:
            score = minimax(newState, depth-1, alpha, beta, true)
            minScore = min(minScore, score)
            beta = min(beta, score)
            if beta â‰¤ alpha:
                break  // Alpha-Beta pruning
        return minScore
```

## UI Controls

### Difficulty Button
- Tap the **"AI: Medium"** button at bottom-right
- Select difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard
- Changes take effect immediately

### Turn Indicator
- Shows **"Red's Turn"** when it's your turn
- Shows **"Black's Turn (AI)"** when waiting for AI
- Shows **"AI Thinking..."** while AI calculates

### Reset Button
- Tap **"Reset"** to start a new game
- Resets to red's turn with all pieces restored

## Game Over
- Alert appears when one side has no pieces left
- Shows "You Win!" or "AI Wins!"
- Tap "New Game" to play again

## Implementation Details

### Key Classes

**AIPlayer.swift**
- `getBestMove()` - Main entry point for AI move selection
- `minimax()` - Recursive minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- `evaluateBoard()` - Heuristic evaluation function
- `getAllValidMoves()` - Generates all legal moves
- `getCaptureMoves()` - Finds capture opportunities
- `getRegularMoves()` - Finds non-capture moves

**GameViewController.swift**
- `makeAIMove()` - Triggers AI calculation on background thread
- `getCurrentGameState()` - Converts renderer state to AI format
- `applyAIMove()` - Executes AI's chosen move
- `checkGameOver()` - Detects win/loss conditions

### Performance
- **Easy**: ~0.1 seconds per move
- **Medium**: ~0.5 seconds per move
- **Hard**: ~2-5 seconds per move

AI runs on a background thread to keep UI responsive.

## Strategy Tips

### To Beat the AI:
1. **Control the center** - Central pieces are more valuable
2. **Get kings early** - Kings are 3x more valuable
3. **Force trades when ahead** - Simplify when winning
4. **Avoid edges** - Edge pieces are easier to trap
5. **Plan captures** - Look for multi-jump opportunities

### AI Weaknesses:
- **Easy mode** makes random moves sometimes
- **Medium mode** can be outmaneuvered with tactics
- **Hard mode** is challenging but can be beaten with perfect play

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Opening book for faster early game
- [ ] Endgame database for perfect play
- [ ] Learning from player strategies
- [ ] Multiplayer over network
- [ ] Save/load game state
- [ ] Move hints for player
- [ ] Undo/redo moves

## Technical Notes

### Thread Safety
- AI calculation runs on background thread
- UI updates on main thread only
- Player input disabled during AI's turn

### Memory Management
- Efficient state representation
- Pruning reduces memory usage
- No memory leaks with weak self references

### Game Rules Compliance
- Mandatory captures
- Multi-jump chains
- King promotion
- Direction restrictions
- All standard checkers rules
