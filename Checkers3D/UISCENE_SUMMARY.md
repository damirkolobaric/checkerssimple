# UIScene Support - Quick Summary âœ¨

## What Was Added

### 3 Files Changed + 1 New File

1. **SceneDelegate.swift** âœ¨ NEW
   - Manages window and scene lifecycle
   - Creates GameViewController in window scene

2. **AppDelegate.swift** ðŸ”„ UPDATED
   - Removed direct window management
   - Added scene configuration methods

3. **Info.plist** ðŸ”„ UPDATED
   - Added UISceneConfigurations
   - Registered SceneDelegate

## Quick Comparison

### Before (Old)
```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
var window: UIWindow?
window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
window?.rootViewController = GameViewController()
```

### After (New)
```swift
// SceneDelegate.swift
var window: UIWindow?
window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
window?.rootViewController = GameViewController()
```

## Benefits

âœ… Modern iOS 13+ architecture  
âœ… Better lifecycle management  
âœ… Foundation for multi-window support  
âœ… Follows Apple best practices  
âœ… Ready for state restoration

â”œâ”€â”€ GameViewController.swift (Game logic)
â””â”€â”€ Info.plist             (Scene config)
```

## Key Changes

### AppDelegate
- Removed: `var window: UIWindow?`
- Removed: Window creation code
- Added: `configurationForConnecting` method
- Added: `didDiscardSceneSessions` method

### SceneDelegate (NEW)
- Added: `var window: UIWindow?`
- Added: Scene lifecycle methods
- Creates window with windowScene

### Info.plist
- Added: `UISceneConfigurations` dictionary

## Testing

The app now:
1. âœ… Launches via SceneDelegate
2. âœ… Creates window in scene context
3. âœ… Handles background/foreground properly
4. âœ… Uses modern iOS architecture

**All features work exactly the same - just with better architecture!** ðŸŽ¯
